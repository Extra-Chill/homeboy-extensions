# Node.js Trace Helpers

The Node.js trace runner exposes reusable helpers for black-box desktop and
window lifecycle scenarios. Scenarios can import them from
`$HOMEBOY_TRACE_HELPER_DIR`.

```js
const helperDir = process.env.HOMEBOY_TRACE_HELPER_DIR;
const { createTraceRecorder } = await import(`${helperDir}/timeline.mjs`);
const { launchProcess, captureProcessTree, waitForExit } = await import(`${helperDir}/process.mjs`);
```

## Stable Helpers

- `timeline.mjs` records timestamped events, assertions, artifacts, and writes
  the final Homeboy trace JSON envelope.
- `process.mjs` launches black-box commands, captures a best-effort process
  tree artifact on macOS/Linux, waits for exits, and cleans up spawned process
  groups on process exit/signals.
- `artifacts.mjs` resolves artifact paths under `HOMEBOY_TRACE_ARTIFACT_DIR` and
  returns paths relative to that directory for trace envelopes.
- `process.sh` provides shell equivalents for simple scenarios:
  `trace_launch`, `trace_process_tree`, `trace_tail_log`, and automatic cleanup.

## Platform-Specific Helpers

- `desktop.mjs` is macOS-first. `observeVisibleWindows()` uses System Events and
  returns `{ status: 'skipped' }` on unsupported platforms. Permission or
  automation failures return `{ status: 'unknown' }`, not a thrown exception.
- `captureScreenshot()` uses macOS `screencapture` and similarly degrades to
  `skipped` or `unknown` evidence when unavailable.

Helpers are intentionally generic and contain no target-app-specific behavior.
