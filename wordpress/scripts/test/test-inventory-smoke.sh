# Extra-Chill/homeboy#12394 — WordPress test inventory producer.
#
# Sharded execution needs the suite enumerated without running it. Homeboy core
# re-derives both fingerprints itself and refuses anything that does not match,
# so the producer's only job is to agree with core exactly. Two properties carry
# that agreement and are asserted here:
#
#   * the workspace fingerprint responds to declared files and ignores
#     everything else, including skipped directories;
#   * `inventory_fingerprint` is the sha256 of
#     `json.dumps(record_without_that_key, sort_keys=True, separators=(",",":"))`,
#     which is the byte layout core reproduces by hand.
#
# Enumeration must also match the runner's default release gates. Explicit
# diagnostic smoke targets must not become required checks merely because the
# suite is sharded.
